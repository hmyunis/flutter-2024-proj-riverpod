# Video Game Catalogue: The Mobile App

## Description

Video Game Catalogue is a comprehensive mobile application tailored for gaming enthusiasts. This project encompasses two primary features: **game management** and **review system**.

The game management feature allows users to effortlessly navigate through a diverse catalog of games and add them to their personal collection. Within their collection, games can be categorized into 'Pinned' and 'Unpinned' sections, offering users a structured overview of their current gaming interests. Users also retain the ability to remove games from their collection, ensuring flexibility and customization.

The review system is designed to facilitate detailed feedback and ratings for each game in the collection. Users can leave comprehensive reviews along with a 5-star rating system. Furthermore, they can explore reviews from other users, write their own, edit existing reviews, and delete them as needed.

In essence, Video Game Catalogue offers a streamlined experience for users to manage their gaming preferences and engage with a community-driven review system, all within a user-friendly Flutter application.
